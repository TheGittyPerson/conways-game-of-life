## Opening Issues

**We highly recommend [opening an issue][issues]** before creating a 
pull request. This is to ensure all changes are discussed properly (and you 
don't waste your time creating a PR that ends up getting closed). 

This is also to prevent automatically-generated pull requests created by 
automated bot accounts with minimal human insight.

### Reporting Bugs

To report a bug:
1. On the repository on GitHub, go to the [Issues] tab.
2. Select "New issue".
3. Use the bug report template section.
4. Describe the issue thoroughly, using the template as a guide
5. Submit the issue.

### Suggesting Features

## Code Guidelines

Follow [PEP 8]:
- **Line length** (try to keep lines **below 80 characters**; PEP 8 says 79 but
  both work)
- **Naming conventions** (module, variable, class, and function names)
  - `variable_must_be_named_like_this`
  - `functions_too`
  - `also_modules`
  - `ClassesMustBeNamedLikeThis`
- **Docstring and comments formatting**
- **Line separations** (2 blank lines around classes and functions, etc.)
- **Order of import statements** (standard → third-party → local)
